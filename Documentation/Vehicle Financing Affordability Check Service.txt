Rules
-----------------------

The customer is able to afford the loan if they meet all the points given below - if one
point fails in the sequence, then it is regarded as the client cannot afford the loan:

1.	The customer must earn a nett income of at least R8500 per month. 
The service assumes that the income is deposited into their bank account each month and the customer
must have worked for at least 3 months (in combination with the current and previous employer).

2.	If so, then we calculate the amount the customer will be left with after their basic expenses and credit are deducted:

Amount Left = Nett Income - (Total Monthly Expenses + Total Credit)

If the customer is left with an amount less than R5000 after this calculation above, then
the customer is deemed as being unable to afford a vehicle loan.

3. If the customer is left with an amount equal to or greater than R5000 per month, from the calculation above then
the maximum loan amount is calculated that the person can be granted.

CALCULATION (A):

Amount Left = Nett Income - (Total Monthly Expenses + Total Credit)
Fixed Number of Terms = 60

Maximum Allowed Loan Amount (Over 60 months / 5 years) = (35% of the Amount Left) * Fixed Number of Terms
 
if Maximum Allowed Loan Amount > Requested Loan Amount then the customer cannot
qualify for a loan.  

CALCULATION (B):

If the customer requested loan amount that they are allowed to be granted, then the following
calculation is performed:

Amount Left = Nett Income - (Total Monthly Expenses + Total Credit)
Total Interests Amount = ((Loan Amount - Deposit) + Extras Total + Admin Fees) * Fixed Interest Rate
Instalments to be paid = (((Loan Amount - Deposit) + Extras Total + Admin Fees) + Total Interests Amount) / Number of Terms

if (Amount Left - Instalments to be paid) is greater than or equal to R2500, 
then the customer qualifies for the loan.

Both calculations A and B must pass for the customer to be deemed to be able to afford.
